    "   - Lines starting with `#` are comments. They are not executed by the program but help explain the code.\n",

    "2. **Function Definition:**\n",
    "   - `def print_greeting():`\n",
    "   - This line defines a function named `print_greeting`.\n",
    "   - Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They can be reused multiple times in a program.\n",
    "   - The `def` keyword is used to define a function, followed by the function name and parentheses `()`.\n",

    "   - `print(\"Hello, world!\");`\n",
    "   - This line is indented and is part of the function body. It specifies what the function does.\n",

    "4. **Function Call:**\n",
    "   - `print_greeting()`\n",
    "   - This line calls the `print_greeting` function, which means it tells the program to execute the code inside the function.\n",
    "   - When the function is called, it prints \"Hello, world!\" to the screen."
